## ANYJAM To [Fredd-Red](https://dsc.gg/freds).
### Bro is a very simple npm although it was only for my use but I think it's public xd.
### Anyway, it's just an npm that allows you to have images of cats and dogs xd.
### I may add more things in the future

## Instalation
```npm i anyjam```

## Usage
```js
const { anyCat, anyDog } = require("anyjam") //Define the module
let random = anyDog[Math.floor(Math.random() * anyDog.length)] //You get an image of a dog or a cat in case you use "anyCat"



```
